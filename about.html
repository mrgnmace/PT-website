            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>I’m Nikki, a mother, Women’s Wellness Coach and owner of OptiMum P.T. in Cambridge.  I first started working in the fitness industry in 2000 after finishing my degree in Dance Performance. Sports and fitness have always been my passion, so after working as a dancer it felt like a natural progression to move into Personal Training. I worked with clients one to one and as a manager in several studios in London. I instructed classes from Spinning to Body Balance and couldn’t get enough! After 7 years of teaching back to back classes and clients, my body became fatigued and so I decided I needed a change. I retrained as a PE and Dance teacher with an aim to inspire children to look after their bodies and find joy in movement.
                <br><br>
                In 2010 I moved to Cambridge, worked in an amazing school and whilst teaching had two children of my own.
                <br><br>
                
                A tricky pregnancy and a big baby (11lbs 4oz), left me with a large dysfunctional diastasis (tummy gap) and hip problems. The lack of sleep and time zapped any motivation to do what I had loved, exercise. Post natal depression hit with the absence of sleep and I felt I had lost myself somewhere in the process of becoming a mum. I eventually found an amazing trainer who helped me reconnect with my body and get it functioning as it should. My love for movement returned and I felt like myself again.
                <br><br>
                
                This encounter inspired me to reach out to other women and use my experiences and qualifications to return to working as a Fitness coach. I took my Level 3 Pre and Postnatal Instructor qualification and then became a graduate of Burrell Education’s revolutionary courses in Pregnancy and Postnatal Exercise Prescription and Nutrition. Leading onto their 3rd age Peri- Post Menopause Wellness Coach Certification. I am a Holistic Core Restore® Coach enabling me to run programmes to help women at ALL phases of their life, with their pelvic and core health. I am also a fully qualified sports massage therapist and can work with abdominal scars.  Teaching and treating women and then seeing them become confident in their bodies brings me so much joy.
                <br><br>
                
                I aim to reach out and support women to enable them to become the best version of themselves. It is a privilege for me to help women find strength on their journey through motherhood and beyond.</p>
